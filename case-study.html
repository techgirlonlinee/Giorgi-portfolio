            <p>A virtual campfire app as a method of intervention, providing an exclusive environment for Fellows and reduce the
                chances of relapse for youths. The app enables fellows to share daily “live” moments to stay connected with each other,
                even after the clinic. Being by the campfire, the fellows will be in each other’s warmth and share deep connections &

                    with the clinic itself. It is a modern serif that is contemporary, robust, and clear. It also has oscillating
                    characteristics between playful yet warm curves and sharp details that youths who has been through a difficult time can
                    relate to.

                    <p>The utilitarian typeface provides a lot of legibility without grabbing too much attention, allowing the illustrations to

                    <p>Inspired by the campfire, two contrasting colours were selected: night blue for the UI background and elements, and
                    orange to represent sunset for the accent colour. The colour combination creates a visually balanced feeling of a warmly
                    lit campfire to comfort the user in the dark night.
                    </p>
                    <p>Playful and nongeometric shapes helped us to create more joyful experience - they’re mostly inspired by the dinamic
                    shape of campfire itself. The link between UI and the session scene is strong which emphesizes feeling of consistency.</p>

                    Illustrations are the essence of the application but with limited time this process of art direction was done simultaneously with
                    UI design. We had to create delightful, cozy, and emotional experience that would please both client and customers while
                    they have contrasting preferences, resulting in several iterations. The client preferred pixelated illustrations with
                    darker colors while the customers liked bright colors with charcoal textured illustrations.
                </p>
                <p>For the final results, we used storytelling to immerse users into the experience. We separated scene in to two parts: 1)
                the horizon and 2) the campfire. For the first scene we used sunset tones; for the second, we used darker colors but
                illuminated with campfire’s cozy light. With the help of scenes division, were used both palletes the sceen to satisfy
                both users and client.</p>
